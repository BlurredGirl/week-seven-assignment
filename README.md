Requirements
Make in the order:
Database (Supabase),
Server (Express),
Client (React)

🎯 Design a database schema with relationships between tables

🎯 Create a new application with a React client and an Express server
(again, remember the client and the server should be separate)

🎯 Seed the database with data. Either run your SQL queries in Supabase SQL Editor OR use a seed.js file. (if you use the Supabase editor, save the scripts you run in a file in your project, in case you need to rerun them, or we need to duplicate the project)

🎯 Create Express endpoints to handle requests so you can POST and GET the data appropriately for your application.

🎯 Create multiple pages using react-router-dom

🎯 Create a home page.
🎯 Create a page to show all the posts and use fetch to call your server to get your data.
🎯 Create a page where users can create new posts using a form.
