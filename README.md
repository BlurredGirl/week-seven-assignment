User Stories
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to create new posts and add them to the page
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to assign a category to each post
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to view all posts added on the page and the category they're in

Requirements
Make in the order:
Database (Supabase),
Server (Express),
Client (React)

🎯 Design a database schema with relationships between tables
🎯 Create a new application with a React client and an Express server
🎯 Seed the database with data. Either run your SQL queries in Supabase SQL Editor OR use a seed.js file. (if you use the Supabase editor, save the scripts you run in a file in your project, in case you need to rerun them, or we need to duplicate the project)
🎯 Create Express endpoints to handle requests so you can POST and GET the data appropriately for your application.
🎯 Create multiple pages using react-router-dom
🎯 Create a home page.
🎯 Create a page to show all the posts and use fetch to call your server to get your data.
🎯 Create a page where users can create new posts using a form.
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to add new categories (Stretch Goal)

(Required)
🎯 Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
I met all user story needs and all assignment requirements, including one stretch goal (🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to add new categories (Stretch Goal))


🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
I did not attempt a second stretch goal.


🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I think I would have needed to change the way that I set up my categories if I had wanted to add the second stretch goal (view all posts in a specific category on a dedicated category page).


(Optional)
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.
 
What went really well and what could have gone better?
- I found setting up the database on Supabase quite straight forward, and found my stride with CSS and styling this week.

Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).
- Support from Manny & Frankie when trying to connect my registration form to the posts/attendees page - thank you!

Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.
- I really struggled to get the form submissions to show on the attendees page, but got there in the end!

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
- Is there a better way that I could have gone about setting up the categories to make them filter-able?
